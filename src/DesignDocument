LinearEquation class
Instance variables:
private int x
private int y
private int x2
private int y2

Methods:
public double slope(int x, int y, int x2, int y2)
returns (y2 - y1) - (x2 - x1) + "x" and converts into fraction

public int yIntercept(int x, int y)
returns (0-x)*slope + y

public double distance(int x, int y, int x2, int y2)
returns square root of (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2

public double solveCoordinatePoint(int x)
plugs in x into linear equation and returns (x,y)

public String toString()
displays all information

Constructor:
public LinerEquation(double slope, int yIntercept)
returns slope + " +" + yIntercept
